# Hotel_Demand

One kind of project I wanted to conduct was a simple Exploratory Data Analysis. This would generally mean getting an overall summary of the dataset, clean some of the columns, outline the of the numerical and categorical variables, as well as outlinte the deviations in numerical groups.

This is a fictional dataset that describes the customer base of a fictional hotel chain. There are two branches in this chain - "City Hotel" and "Resort Hotel". This data set records a number of variables - such as occupation, children in Party, nights stayed, and reservation status.

Considering the data available and the scope of the project, I'd like to understand the distribution of the categorical and numerical factors. I'd particularly like to understand how stay length varies throughout the year - along with the deviation of those variables. Moreover, I'd like to understand how the family dynamic influences these factors.
